# Autonomous-Robots-final-project


Our final project is the expansion of assignment 1.
<br>In assignment 1 we had to simulate a drone in 2D space. 
<br>The drone had to explore its world using only 4 lidar sensors left, right, forward, and backward trying to explore as much as it could of its world, without crashing into the ‘walls’.

<br>For this assignment, we will simulate a drone in 3D space. 
<br>We will teach it to autonomously explore and navigate its world using only 6 lidar sensors, left, right, forward, backward, up, and down without crashing and staying at a fixed height above the ground.  
Additionally, the drown will also learn to search and navigate till its battery is half full then it will return to where it started.


<br> We will try to use reinforcement learning to do so, and if that doesn’t succeed on its own, we will try to use a mix of a control algorithm with the reinforcement learning algorithm.
